    "# Groundwater Flow and Contaminant Transport\n",
    "In this section, we focus on modeling the solution to the coupled groundwater flow and transport equations, considering uncertainty in the permeability of the medium. This coupling is a comprehensive model of the groundwater flow and contaminant transport. The aim is to study contaminant transport by inversely solving the the advection-diffusion equation where the flow velocity derived from the flow equation emerges as a coefficient. Since the permeability affects the transport of the solute, it also leads to uncertainty in the solute concentration $c$.\n",

    "### Groundwater Flow Model\n",
    "We consider a 2D isotropic porous medium defined by a domain $O \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. The soil permeability in this domain is characterized by a function that provides a permeability value for each location. Since the soil is heterogeneous and not enough measurements are made on it, our access to the permeability values at each point is limited. Therefore we consider the model permeability as a random field, $a: \\Omega \\times O \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Ideally, we can take a homogeneous lognormal field to model the permeability field:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "a(\\omega, X) = e^{g(\\omega, X)}, \\qquad  X \\in O, \\quad \\omega \\in \\Omega, \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ is the position of a point with two coordinates $x,y$ in a given refential system, $\\Omega$ represents the set of all possible realizations $\\omega$, which can be thought of as different \"random scenarios\" and $g$ is a Gaussian field defined by a mean $\\mu=0$, a variance $\\sigma^2 = 0.5$ and a covariance function that is of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "cov[g](X_1,X_2) = \\sigma^2 exp \\left(- \\frac{\\lVert X_1-X_2 \\rVert ^\\delta}{L^\\delta}  \\right) \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L= 10$ $m$ is correlation length and $\\delta=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical laws governing the steady flow in porous media are mass conservation and Darcy's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "v(\\omega, X) = -a(\\omega, X) \\nabla p(\\omega, X), & \\text{in } \\Omega \\times O \\\\\n",
    "\\nabla \\cdot v(\\omega, X) = 0, & \\text{in } \\Omega \\times O\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is the Darcy velocity and $p$ is the hydraulic head. Boundary conditions should be applied to the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Transport Model\n",
    "We consider an inert solute in the porous medium and transported by advection and diffusion. Also assume that it is homogeneous and isotropic (i.e., there are no variations in properties of the porous medium with location and they are the same in all directions). This type of solute transport is described by the following equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial c(\\omega, X, t)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot ( c(\\omega, X, t) v(\\omega,X)) -  \\nabla \\cdot (D(\\omega, X) \\nabla c(\\omega, X, t) ) = 0\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c(\\omega, X, t)$ is the solute concentration which is a function of random realization $\\omega$, spatial location $X=(x,y)$, and time $t$, $v$ is the Darcy velocity defined in the Groundwater Flow Model, $D(\\omega, X)$ is the molecular diffusion coefficent and suppose that it is constant, say $10 ^{âˆ’9}$ $m^2/s$. The initial condition is deterministic and is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "c(\\omega, X, t) = c_0(X)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the goal of this exercise to find a posterior for solute concentration. For its initialization, prior and likelihood distributions should be constructed. Assuming that the data $Y$ is generated by solving the forward problem and is subject to the addition of zero-mean Gaussian noise, $\\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_{noise}^2)$, the posterior distribution can be written as in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(c(X, t) | Y_{obs}) \\propto P(Y_{obs} | c(X,t), g)P(g)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the **likelihood function** describes the probability of the observed data given the solute concentration and permeability field, and **the prior distribution** represents the prior knowledge about the permeability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** \n",
    "\n",
    "i) Given that systems above are stochastic partial differential equations, it is essential to employ specialized methods. Apply the sampling method that you think is suitable and generate multiple realizations $\\{a(\\omega_i, X)\\}$. For each realizations solve these equations to obtain observed data $Y$. Since these equations are typically too complex to solve analytically, choose a numerical method to approximate. \n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Construct the posterior distribution for solute concentration. \n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Develop an MCMC procedure. Explain what do you observe.\n"

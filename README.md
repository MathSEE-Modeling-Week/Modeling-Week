# MathSEE Modeling-Week
## What is the Modeling-Week?
As a student of a mathematical-methodical subject or the SEE subjects, you will come into contact with current and concrete mathematical questions of an interdisciplinary nature during the modeling week. You will work intensively for one week in small teams online or in a conference house on a question from the new KIT Center Mathematics in Sciences, Engineering and Economics, both from the university and the large-scale research area of the KIT. You will be supported by professors and research assistants. Your task will be to solve these problems by developing mathematical models and computer programs and by continuously refining your solution. After the week you will present your results to the advisors as part of a closing event online at KIT Campus South. The MathSEE Modeling Week complements your field of study and gives you insight into the application of mathematical modeling to highly relevant research topics. Moreover, the MathSEE Modeling Week gives you the opportunity to arrange student jobs, find an interesting topic for your thesis or deepen your knowledge as an enrolled graduate student.

## Introduction 
As a start you can follow the exercises below and at any point start working on your own projects.
The exercises include mathematiacally modeled problems like the Heat Conduction Model and the 3 Body Problem. For the Uncertainty Quantification methods you can find examples for calssic Monte Carlo (MC), Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). 
When moveing forward with the exercises we will introduce UM-Bridge. You can check out the [UM-Bridge Documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/index.html) and follow the Quickstart Guide and/or the Tutorial to get familiar with UM-Bridge.

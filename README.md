# MathSEE Modeling-Week
## What is the Modeling-Week?
As a student of a mathematical-methodical subject or the SEE subjects, you will come into contact with current and concrete mathematical questions of an interdisciplinary nature during the modeling week. You will work intensively for one week in small teams online or in a conference house on a question from the new KIT Center Mathematics in Sciences, Engineering and Economics, both from the university and the large-scale research area of the KIT. You will be supported by professors and research assistants. Your task will be to solve these problems by developing mathematical models and computer programs and by continuously refining your solution. After the week you will present your results to the advisors as part of a closing event online at KIT Campus South. The MathSEE Modeling Week complements your field of study and gives you insight into the application of mathematical modeling to highly relevant research topics. Moreover, the MathSEE Modeling Week gives you the opportunity to arrange student jobs, find an interesting topic for your thesis or deepen your knowledge as an enrolled graduate student.
## Introduction
To connect various computer programs you will be using UM-Bridge. For the installation and an introduction into the workings of UM-Bridge, check out the [UM-Bridge Documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/index.html) and follow the Quickstart Guide and/or the Tutorial.
In this course we are bringing together Uncertainty Quantification models and simulation models to solve them:
### Uncertainty Quantification models
...
### Simulation models
...

In the following a step by step description is given to a first exercise, that will give you an idea of the desired workflow. Afte completing the first exercise or if you are already familiar with the workings of UM-Bridge you can move on to more advanced exercises or work on your own problems. 

## First Exercise
What exactly should this exercise contain? (which UQ and which simulation models)
and should both then just be run and connected to each other or should there be something else to do?

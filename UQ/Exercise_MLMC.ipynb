    "# Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to understand and implement the **Multilevel Monte Carlo method (MLMC)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the [Acta Numerica article by Giles](https://doi.org/10.1017/S096249291500001X), which provides a comprehensive mathematical background on MLMC.\n",

    "**Abstract:**\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods are a very general and useful approach for the estimation of expectations arising from stochastic simulation. However, they can be computationally expensive, particularly when the cost of generating individual stochastic samples is very high, as in the case of stochastic PDEs. Multilevel Monte Carlo is a recently developed approach which greatly reduces the computational cost by performing most simulations with low accuracy at a correspondingly low cost, with relatively few simulations being performed at high accuracy and a high cost.\n",
    "In this article, we review the ideas behind the multilevel Monte Carlo method, and various recent generalizations and extensions, and discuss a number of applications which illustrate the flexibility and generality of the approach and the challenges in developing more efficient implementations with a faster rate of convergence of the multilevel correction variance.\n",

    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "The key idea behind the Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimator is to use samples of an approximation of the quantity of interest $Q$ on a **hierarchy of different levels**. We denote by $Q_l$ **the approximation of the quantity of interest at level $l=0,1,...,L$**, where $L$ is the finest level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation of $Q_{L}$ can be decomposed as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[Q_{L}] = \\mathbb{E}[Q_{0}] + \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} \\mathbb{E}[Q_{\\ell} - Q_{{\\ell-1}}].\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can express the total expectation as a sum of expectations on each level:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[Q] \\approx \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{L} \\mathbb{E}[Y_\\ell],\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y_{\\ell} := Q_{\\ell} - Q_{{\\ell-1}}$ for $\\ell \\geq 1$ and $Y_0 := Q_{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\hat{Y}_\\ell$ be an estimator for $\\mathbb{E}[Y_\\ell]$, $l=0,..,L$, we define the **Multilevel Estimator** as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{Q}^{ML}_L = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{L} \\hat{Y}_\\ell.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\hat{Y}_\\ell$ is itself a standard Monte Carlo estimator, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{Y}_0 = \\frac{1}{N_0} \\sum_{k=1}^{N_0} Q_{0}^{(k)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "and for levels $\\ell = 1, \\dots, L$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{Y}_\\ell = \\frac{1}{N_\\ell} \\sum_{k=1}^{N_\\ell} \\left( Q_{l}^{(k)} - Q_{l-1}^{(k)} \\right),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives us the **Multilevel Monte Carlo Estimator**. $\\hat{Q}^{ML}_L$ is an unbiased estimator of $Q$.\n",

    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start by:\n",
    "- Implementing a simple **MLMC algorithm** with two or three levels.\n",
    "- Compare the results and computational time with a standard Monte Carlo method for the same problem.\n",
    "- Investigate the impact of the number of levels and sample sizes on accuracy and performance.\n",

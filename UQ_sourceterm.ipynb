It means that, we have a low permeability elliptic region within the model which represents a specific area within the model where the permeability $K_e$ is significantly lower than background permeability $K_b$, i.e. $K_e < K_b$. These low permeability regions can respresent some features (s.t. barriers, layers) that reduce the flow of the grounwater. 2D elliptic region can be defined by the equation\n",

    "We consider an inert solute in the porous medium and transported by advection and diffusion. Also assume that it is nonhomogeneous and isotropic. This type of solute transport is described by the following equation \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial c(x, y, t)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot ( c(x, y, t) v(x, y)) -  \\nabla \\cdot (D(x, y) \\nabla c(x, y, t) ) = Q(x, y, t)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a rectangle domain $[0, L_x] \\times [0, L_y]$, the boundary and the initial conditions should be set for each model. For simplicity, we can choose Dirichlet boundary conditions for both model and provide the initial hydraulic head as $h(x,y, t=0)=h_0(x,y)$ and the initial contaminant concentration as $c(x,y,t=0) = c_0(x,y)$.\n",

    "where $\\delta$ is the Dirac delta dunction and $(x_{true}, y_{true})$ is the location of the suspected source. We can call it suspected source because based on historical data or previous experiments, investigations we may have prior knowledge about the location of the contaminant source. Correspondingly, we further assume that the data $Y$ represents the solution of the forward problem (**coupled groundwater flow and transport equations**) with added zero-centered Gaussian noise\n",

    "i) Assign a constant value $K_b$ to the entire domain and $K_e$ to the elliptic region, also specify the locations, sizes or orientations of the elliptic region and discretize the permeability field and also the time domain for solving the problems numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) After collect noisy field data on contaminant concentrations at certain locations and times, construct likelihood function and define prior distribution for the source term. Then obtain the posterior distribution. \n",
